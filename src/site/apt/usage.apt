Usage

    This section shows how to use the JVM watchdog.

* Installation

    [[1]] Download the distribution archive

    [[2]] Unzip the downloaded file

    [[3]] Open the distribution directory
   

* Run
    
    Every command must be executed in the installation directory. Next, run the
    script that matches to your system.
    
    You have to provide the pid of the JVM that you want to monitor to the script.

    Warning: The <<JAVA_HOME>> environment variable must be set before running any script.

** Unix

    Execute the sh script:

+------------------------------------------------------
./run-with-unsecured-jmx.sh <pid>
+------------------------------------------------------

** Windows

    Execute the bat script:

+------------------------------------------------------
run-with-unsecured-jmx.bat <pid>

    Each script launches the JVM Watchdog with JMX enabled on port 9999, but without any
    authentication.

    To shutdown the watchdog, execute the shutdown script:

** Unix

./shutdown.sh
+------------------------------------------------------
