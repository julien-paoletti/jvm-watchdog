About

    This is a tool that monitors a given JVM process in order to detect any failures that may occur.

    JVM Watchdog dynamically attaches java agents to JVMs, and agents send heartbeats
    every second to the watchdog. Each heartbeat contains monitoring data that are stored by the watchdog
    within CSV files in a dedicated directory.
